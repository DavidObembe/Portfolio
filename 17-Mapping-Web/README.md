# Leaflet Project - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background
This is a leaflet Map that displays all the earthquakes that have occured in the world over the past 30 days with a magnitude above 4.5. The earthquake magnitudes are represented on the map with colors and circle sizes that signify earthquake severity and the timing of the earthquake can be revealed on-click of these circles.

The earthquake data is constantly being updated from an earthquake API that records the most recent earthquakes worldwide.
